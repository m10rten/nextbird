## Installation

```bash
npm install nextbird
```

## Usage

In your routes files, you can use the `nextbird` function to create a route handler.

This must be done directly in the following route file: `app/api/health/[bird]/route.{ts,js}`.

This file then should look something like this:

```ts
// app/api/health/[bird]/route.ts
import { nextbird } from "nextbird"; // Import the nextbird function
```
